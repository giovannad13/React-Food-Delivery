# React Food Delivery App 🍕🍕

This is a simple food delivery frontend app I built using React and Vite. It’s designed to look and feel like a real food ordering website, with basic features like browsing food items, adding them to your cart, and placing an order.

It’s still a work in progress — the backend will come later — but I wanted to showcase what I’ve built so far.
